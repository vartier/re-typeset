// Versions history:
// 1.0.0: All basic functionality is working. Page segmentation have following
//        features:  finding  lines and  words with  searching of  images with
//        descriptions,  divided words  and new  paragraphs;  finding headers,
//        footers  and  page numbering.  Re-typesetting  can use  all of these
//        informations  to create  new pages with additional features:  adding
//        book reading progress bar and text justification.
